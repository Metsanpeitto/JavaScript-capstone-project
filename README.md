# JavaScript-capstone-project
The JavaScript capstone project is about building our own web application based on an external API. We selected an API that provides data about food and then build the web app around it. The webapp have 3 user interfaces:

- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.
- In this project we also practiced giving code reviews to our teammates.
